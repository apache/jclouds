/**
 * @Deprecated The intention is to use @SinceApiVersion for this purpose, but that would affect
 * a number of APIs, and we would want to have good test coverage before merging that change
 * (in {@link FormSignerUtils#getAnnotatedApiVersion}). However, there is some issue with certain tests at
 * present that means we cannot successfully test all APIs that make use of @SinceApiVersion in order
 * to assure ourselves that FormSignerUtils will not introduce some problem. See
 * <a href="https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds/pull/1102#issuecomment-302682049">
 *    comments on github</a> for details
 * This annotation is introduced as a temporary measure in order to decouple the functionality of
 * {@link FormSignerUtils#getAnnotatedApiVersion} from @SinceApiVersion and the tests in question.
 * It can be removed and replaced by @SinceApiVersion when those tests are fixed.
 *
 * Designates that a method overrides the {@link ApiVersion} on the class with a specific value.
